Here's my workflow:

While True:
    - run script in vscode window
    [dmei@nixos:~/experiments/local_llms/test_portability]$ ./old_gcm_to_merge.sh
    üîç Collecting git diff...
    - cp 'llama_output.log' && Console Log from vscode
    - paste into chatgpt
    - cp snippet from chatgpt
    - paste into script
----------]

It seems like I should be able to automate this, hence the files in /debug_script_snippet
