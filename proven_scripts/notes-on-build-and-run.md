Great questions! Let's break down what you ran and why RAM use might not have increased:

---

### 1. **What model did you run?**

From the output, the model you loaded is:

```
/home/dmei/experiments/local_llms/merged-model/merged_model.gguf
```

**Details from metadata:**

* Model name: `Merged Model`
* Size: `8.0B` parameters (approx. 8 billion)
* Format: GGUF V3 (latest)
* Quantization: Q8\_0 (8-bit quantization)
* Context length: 8192 tokens
* 32 layers, 32 attention heads
* Uses llama architecture

---

### 2. **Why didn't RAM use go up?**

* **8-bit quantization (Q8\_0):**
  The model is quantized to 8-bit, which drastically reduces memory usage compared to 16-bit or 32-bit floating-point weights. This means the RAM footprint is much smaller, which is why you might not see a huge spike in RAM usage.

* **Model loading strategy:**
  `llama.cpp` and its derivatives often use **memory mapping** (`mmap`) for loading models. This means the model file on disk is mapped into virtual memory but not fully loaded into RAM upfront ‚Äî parts are paged in as needed. So, actual RAM usage might appear low until active inference operations require parts of the model.

* **OS caching and reporting:**
  Sometimes Linux memory reporting tools (e.g., `top`, `htop`) show less RAM used because a lot of memory is in shared or cached segments.

---

### 3. **Can you increase performance by allowing it to use more RAM?**

Yes! Some tips:

* **Disable swap or mmap, force loading into RAM:**
  Some inference programs have options to load the entire model into RAM instead of memory-mapping it. This can reduce I/O latency during inference.

* **Use higher precision:**
  Using float16 or float32 weights increases RAM use but may improve accuracy and inference speed depending on your CPU/GPU.

* **Increase context length:**
  Larger context window uses more RAM but allows the model to process longer inputs at once.

* **Batch inference:**
  Processing multiple prompts in parallel can use more RAM but improve throughput.

* **Enable multithreading:**
  Check if `llama-cli` or your runner has options to control number of threads, affinity, or SIMD optimizations.

---

### 4. **How to confirm RAM usage?**

Run `htop` or `free -h` while inference is running. Look for:

* Resident Set Size (RSS) of the process
* Shared vs private memory
* Cached memory from mmap-ed files

---

### 5. **How to tweak your build or run for better RAM and performance?**

You can:

* Pass flags like `--use-mmap=false` if supported by your runner to load the whole model in RAM.
* Experiment with environment variables controlling memory (e.g., for llama.cpp there‚Äôs `GGML_USE_MMAP`).
* Check for command-line options to specify precision, threading, or memory management.

---

### Summary

You built and ran an 8B-parameter, 8-bit quantized llama model (`merged_model.gguf`) with `llama-cli`.
Its low RAM usage is expected due to 8-bit quantization and memory mapping.
You can increase RAM usage/performance by disabling mmap, increasing precision, or batching.

---

If you want, I can help you:

* Identify specific runtime flags to change memory usage
* Suggest commands to monitor RAM during inference
* Help with building a higher-precision or non-mmap version of the model

---

Would you like to see some example commands or config options to tweak this?


==== Human:

Read carefully because this is going to be important.

All of the output I'm about to show is after running the two .sh scripts in /proven_scripts/ that we're using to convert to gguf and build_and_run the model.  When I run both scripts one after another the model successfully runs.  After I exit the build_and_run script I'm still in a nix shell, and cannot ls the .gguf.  After exiting that nix shell, it appears I am still in a nix-shell, and still cannot ls the .gguf.  After exiting the 2nd nix shell, I am at dmei, cannot ls the .gguf.  After all the exit and LS commands I cat the .sh scripts for you.

I do not want to change the .sh scripts, because I am successfully able to run the .gguf with them when run sequentially.  I want you to carefully read and understand all of this, so that you can write a script that will build a persistent .gguf, and then another script that I can use to generate git commits from any folder that I cp the .gguf to.  I don't care if it uses .sh or .py, I want to maximize reliability and portability, and am willing to take on the dependency of having a .gguf file in whatever folder I want to run from.

=== chatGPT:

Thanks for the detailed info and the scripts! I see the core issue clearly now:

---

### Summary of your situation:

* Your **conversion script** (`convert_merged_model_to_gguf.sh`) runs inside a **Python nix-shell** and writes the `.gguf` file *inside* that shell.
* Your **build\_and\_run script** (`build_and_run_llama_with_cmake.sh`) runs inside a **C++ nix-shell** and successfully runs inference with the `.gguf` file.
* However, **after you exit all nix-shells**, the `.gguf` file is missing from your normal user environment (outside nix-shell).
* You want:

  1. A **persistent `.gguf` file** saved *outside* the nix-shell ephemeral environment.
  2. A **reliable, portable script** to copy the `.gguf` file anywhere and run git commit generation commands from there.

---

### Diagnosis:

**Nix-shell creates an isolated environment with its own temporary filesystem overlay or altered environment**, so files created or written inside may not persist to your host filesystem unless you explicitly write to a persistent location.

Your current scripts write to:

```
/home/dmei/experiments/local_llms/merged-model/merged_model.gguf
```

which *should* be persistent, but if inside nix-shell that path is somehow shadowed or mapped differently, it might only exist inside nix-shell overlay and vanish once you exit.

---

### How to fix this?

**The main thing is: ensure your scripts write the `.gguf` file to a fully persistent path on your host filesystem, and confirm your nix-shell does NOT shadow that directory with a temp overlay.**

---

### Step 1: Verify where the `.gguf` file is written inside nix-shell

You can add debugging in the `convert_merged_model_to_gguf.sh` script:

```bash
echo "PWD inside nix-shell: $(pwd)"
echo "Model output dir exists? $(ls -ld /home/dmei/experiments/local_llms/merged-model)"
```

You could also try writing to your home directory directly as a test:

```bash
--outfile /home/dmei/merged_model.gguf
```

Then check if `/home/dmei/merged_model.gguf` exists after you exit nix-shell.

---

### Step 2: Use absolute paths and avoid relative paths

Make sure all paths in scripts are absolute, which you are already doing.

---

### Step 3: Minimize nix-shell filesystem overlay

Your nix-shell might be launched with settings that isolate the environment filesystem. You can test outside nix-shell:

* Run the Python conversion script *directly* outside nix-shell (if dependencies permit).
* Or, modify your nix-shell invocation to **not create an overlay or ephemeral filesystem**, or mount your home directory persistently.

---

### Step 4: Create a **persistent build script** (outside nix-shell)

Here is an example wrapper script that:

* Runs the conversion **inside nix-shell** but writes the `.gguf` to a persistent absolute path.
* Copies the `.gguf` to a destination folder you choose.
* Then, a second script to generate git commits using that `.gguf` anywhere.

---

## Script #1: persistent build + copy `.gguf`

Save this as `build_and_persist_gguf.sh` in `~/experiments/local_llms/proven_scripts/`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

MODEL_DIR="$HOME/experiments/local_llms/merged-model"
PERSISTENT_GGUF="$HOME/experiments/local_llms/persistent_gguf/merged_model.gguf"

mkdir -p "$MODEL_DIR"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$PERSISTENT_GGUF")"

echo "üîÅ Running GGUF conversion inside nix-shell..."
nix-shell "$HOME/experiments/local_llms/nix-shells/python-nix-shell/shell.nix" --run "
  . .venv/bin/activate
  python3 $HOME/experiments/local_llms/llama.cpp/convert_hf_to_gguf.py \
    --outfile $MODEL_DIR/merged_model.gguf \
    --outtype q8_0 \
    $MODEL_DIR
"

echo "‚úÖ Conversion done, verifying output..."
ls -lh "$MODEL_DIR/merged_model.gguf"

echo "üìÇ Copying .gguf to persistent location..."
cp -v "$MODEL_DIR/merged_model.gguf" "$PERSISTENT_GGUF"

echo "‚úÖ .gguf persisted at: $PERSISTENT_GGUF"
```

---

## Script #2: use `.gguf` anywhere + generate git commits

This script assumes you want to:

* Copy the `.gguf` file to any folder.
* Run a git commit message generator script *that you have*.

Example `run_commit_gen.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

if [ "$#" -lt 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <path-to-gguf-folder>"
  exit 1
fi

GGUF_DIR="$1"
GGUF_FILE="$GGUF_DIR/merged_model.gguf"

if [ ! -f "$GGUF_FILE" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå No merged_model.gguf found in $GGUF_DIR"
  exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Found .gguf at $GGUF_FILE"

# Example command: generate conventional commit messages from GGUF in this folder
# Replace with your actual commit generation command
python3 "$HOME/tools/generate_commit_messages.py" --model "$GGUF_FILE" --target-repo "$PWD"

echo "‚úÖ Commit messages generated."
```

---

### Notes:

* You can adjust script #1 to output to any persistent folder (external drive, git repo folder, etc).
* Always use **absolute paths** in your scripts.
* Run script #1 to produce `.gguf` persistently.
* Then, copy `.gguf` to any folder and run script #2 from there to generate commits or inference.

---

### Why this approach?

* Nix-shell may isolate your environment, so writing inside it may create ephemeral files.
* Copying explicitly to a persistent path ensures the file exists after nix-shell exits.
* Having a dedicated `.gguf` folder for your persistent models avoids confusion.
* Script #2 lets you reuse `.gguf` anywhere, cleanly.

---

If you want, I can also help you make a fully portable `.py` script that combines the above logic with argument parsing and better error handling. Just let me know!
