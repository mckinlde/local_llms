The issue you're facing is that the model located in ./models_for_commit_messages is not compatible with HuggingFace’s pipeline("text-generation", model=...) out of the box. It's not a standard Transformers model; it appears to be GGUF or another format not meant for Transformers-based pipelines.

✅ GOAL

You want to:

    Use the model JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages

    Generate commit messages from git diffs or error messages

    Use the HuggingFace transformers pipeline (which expects a proper HuggingFace config.json and pytorch_model.bin, etc.)

❌ CURRENT ISSUE

The error:

    ValueError: Unrecognized model in ./models_for_commit_messages. Should have a model_type key in its config.json

means that the model files downloaded by download_commit_model.sh do not contain a valid config.json with a model_type key, so transformers.pipeline() can't auto-detect the model type.
