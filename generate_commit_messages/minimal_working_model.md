Thanks ‚Äî I now have a complete view of your current project structure. You're almost there! The issue you're facing is that the model located in `./models_for_commit_messages` is **not compatible** with HuggingFace‚Äôs `pipeline("text-generation", model=...)` out of the box. It's not a standard Transformers model; it appears to be GGUF or another format not meant for Transformers-based pipelines.

---

## ‚úÖ GOAL

You want to:

* Use the model `JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages`
* Generate commit messages from git diffs or error messages
* Use the HuggingFace `transformers` pipeline (which expects a proper HuggingFace `config.json` and `pytorch_model.bin`, etc.)

---

## ‚ùå CURRENT ISSUE

The error:

> `ValueError: Unrecognized model in ./models_for_commit_messages. Should have a model_type key in its config.json`

means that the model files downloaded by `download_commit_model.sh` **do not contain a valid `config.json` with a `model_type` key**, so `transformers.pipeline()` can't auto-detect the model type.

---

## ‚úÖ FIX PLAN

You need to:

### 1. **Inspect the downloaded model files**

Confirm whether it's a Transformers-compatible model. Run:

```bash
ls -R generate_commit_messages/models_for_commit_messages
cat generate_commit_messages/models_for_commit_messages/config.json
```

If it's **not** a Transformers model (likely the case), you have two paths:

---

## üõ† Option 1: Use HuggingFace correctly with a standard Transformers model

Instead of `JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages`, use a small text-generation model like `tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b` or `gpt2`:

### ‚úÖ Replace in `download_commit_model.sh`:

```bash
# Standard model like GPT2 or Falcon RW (compatible with HuggingFace Transformers pipeline)
MODEL_NAME="tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b"  # or "gpt2" if you want something smaller
python3 -c "
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download(repo_id='$MODEL_NAME', local_dir='models_for_commit_messages')
"
```

Then update `generate_commit_message.sh`:

```python
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="./models_for_commit_messages", device=-1)
```

---

## üõ† Option 2: If you **must** use `JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages`

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è This repo isn't HuggingFace-native.

Check what type of model it uses ‚Äî from [its README](https://huggingface.co/JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages), it **relies on `llama.cpp` and quantized models**, not PyTorch.

That means you‚Äôll need to **rewrite `generate_commit_message.sh` to call `llama.cpp`**, not `transformers`.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Summary (Recommended Path)

### If you want a **working pipeline quickly**, do this:

**üîÅ Step 1**: Update `download_commit_model.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

pip install huggingface_hub || exit 1

MODEL_NAME="tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b"  # or try "gpt2" for tiny model
python3 -c "
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download(repo_id='$MODEL_NAME', local_dir='models_for_commit_messages')
"
```

**üîÅ Step 2**: Update `generate_commit_message.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
trap "rm -rf $TMP_DIR" EXIT

if [ -n "$1" ]; then
    INPUT_TEXT=$(<"$1")
else
    echo "Paste your git diff or error message (Ctrl+D to finish):"
    INPUT_TEXT=$(cat)
fi

PYTHON_SCRIPT="$TMP_DIR/run_model.py"
cat > "$PYTHON_SCRIPT" <<EOF
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="./models_for_commit_messages")

diff = \"\"\"$INPUT_TEXT\"\"\"

prompt = f"<commit_message>\n{diff}\n"

output = generator(prompt, max_new_tokens=64)[0]["generated_text"]
print(output)
EOF

python "$PYTHON_SCRIPT"
```

**üì¶ Dependencies:**

Make sure you have this in `generate_commit_messages/shell.nix` or use `pip install` for:

```nix
buildInputs = with pkgs; [
  python310
  python310Packages.transformers
  python310Packages.huggingface_hub
];
```

Or activate a venv and install manually:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install transformers huggingface_hub
```

---

Would you prefer to:

**A. Stick with HuggingFace-compatible models** (quick fix, uses GPU/CPU on your system)

**B. Integrate this with llama.cpp** and run a fully local quantized `.gguf` model (more complex, but fully offline + local inference)

Let me know ‚Äî I can guide either direction.


Got it! You want to switch your setup from llama.cpp using a raw quantized GGUF file to leveraging the fine-tuned **CommitWizard** model hosted at Hugging Face under `JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages`‚Äîwhich is a transformer model (based on LLaMA 2 8B) that‚Äôs fine-tuned for commit message generation and is meant to be used with the `transformers` Python library.

---

### What this means for your current architecture:

* **No more llama.cpp binary or GGUF model file.**
  Instead, you‚Äôll run a Python script that loads the Hugging Face model with `transformers`.

* Your input (git diff or commit message summary) will be passed to the tokenizer, then the model will generate a commit message text output.

* This requires Python and `transformers` + `torch` installed (possibly `accelerate` too, for optimized loading).

---

### Here‚Äôs a minimal Python integration example based on your context:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

def main():
    # Load the model and tokenizer once
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages")
    model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages")

    # Read input from stdin (your git diff or description)
    input_text = sys.stdin.read().strip()
    if not input_text:
        print("‚ùå No input detected. Please pipe a git diff or message into this script.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Tokenize and generate
    inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=64, temperature=0.7, repetition_penalty=1.2)
    
    # Decode output tokens to string
    commit_message = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    
    print(commit_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### How to incorporate this:

1. **Install dependencies (preferably in a virtualenv or nix-shell):**

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

2. **Replace your current `generate_commit_message.sh` with a wrapper that calls this Python script**, e.g., `generate_commit_message.py`.

3. **Call it like this in your shell script or testing harness:**

```bash
echo "$SAMPLE_DIFF" | python3 /path/to/generate_commit_message.py
```

---

### Optional: Example of a minimal updated `generate_commit_message.sh` that calls Python:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

ROOT_DIR=~/experiments/local_llms

PY_SCRIPT="$ROOT_DIR/generate_commit_messages/generate_commit_message.py"

if [ ! -f "$PY_SCRIPT" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Python commit message generation script not found at $PY_SCRIPT"
  exit 1
fi

if [ -n "$1" ]; then
  cat "$1" | python3 "$PY_SCRIPT"
else
  echo "Paste your git diff or error message (Ctrl+D to finish):"
  cat | python3 "$PY_SCRIPT"
fi
```

---

If you want, I can help you prepare a nix-shell environment with Python + transformers, or help refactor your entire pipeline to this new setup. Just ask!

The error:

```
ValueError: Unrecognized model in JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages. Should have a `model_type` key in its config.json, or contain one of the following strings in its name: ...
```

means that the `transformers` library‚Äôs `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained()` can't automatically identify the model architecture from the repo metadata/configuration.

---

### Why this happens

* The model `JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages` is an **adapter** or fine-tuned model based on **Meta‚Äôs LLaMA 2 8B**, but **it is not a full transformer model repo compatible with the vanilla `transformers` API** for direct loading.
* It lacks a proper `config.json` that defines a recognized `model_type` for `transformers` to auto-detect how to instantiate it.
* It probably relies on **adapter-style fine-tuning** or **PEFT** (parameter-efficient fine-tuning), or a custom loading procedure.

---

### How to fix / properly load this model

You have two main paths:

---

## Option 1: Load the base model + apply the adapter weights manually (PEFT style)

This repo likely requires you to:

1. Download and load the **base LLaMA 2 8B** model weights (which you must have or can access).

2. Load the **adapter weights** (`adapter_model.safetensors`) as a PEFT adapter on top of the base model.

3. Use the [PEFT library](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) or a custom adapter loading routine to merge/inject the adapter weights.

This is *not* as simple as calling `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained` on the adapter repo directly.

---

## Option 2: Use `transformers` + `peft` + `safetensors` and custom code

You can do the following in Python:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, LlamaForCausalLM
from peft import PeftModel

# Load base LLaMA 2 8B (you need to have access to this model locally or via HF)
base_model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-8b-hf", device_map="auto", torch_dtype=torch.float16)

# Load tokenizer (usually the base model tokenizer)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-8b-hf")

# Load adapter weights on top of the base model
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages")

# Example input and generate
inputs = tokenizer("Refactor user authentication module", return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=64)
commit_message = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(commit_message)
```

---

### Requirements:

* You **must have access to the base model** `"meta-llama/Llama-2-8b-hf"` or a compatible LLaMA 2 8B Hugging Face checkpoint.

* Install PEFT library:

```bash
pip install peft
```

* Make sure you have `transformers`, `torch`, and `safetensors` installed.

---

### Why?

* This repo contains **only adapter weights** (`adapter_model.safetensors`), which are *not* standalone models.
* `transformers` cannot instantiate them alone without the base model.
* PEFT loads adapters as delta weights on top of the base model.

---

## Alternative

If you **do not have the base LLaMA 2 8B model**, you cannot load this adapter model.

---

### TL;DR: You need to

1. Download base LLaMA 2 8B model from HF (`meta-llama/Llama-2-8b-hf`) ‚Äî this requires access.

2. Use `transformers` + `peft` to load base + adapter (JosineyJr repo).

3. Then generate commit messages.

---

### I can help you set this up if you have the base model locally or access on HF.

### Optional: For your current environment, here‚Äôs a sketch to update your script:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, LlamaForCausalLM
from peft import PeftModel

def main():
    base_model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-2-8b-hf"
    adapter_name = "JosineyJr/generate-conventional-commit-messages"

    print("Loading base model...")
    base_model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained(base_model_name, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map="auto")
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_name)

    print("Loading adapter weights...")
    model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, adapter_name)
    model.eval()

    input_text = input("Paste your git diff or message: ")

    inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=64, temperature=0.7)
    commit_message = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

    print("\nGenerated Commit Message:\n", commit_message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
